# DDS Reader
A DDS reader in C#, extracted and refactored from [igaeditor](https://github.com/micolous/igaeditor).
With updates found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/soeminnminn/e9c4c99867743a717f5b), to cater for more formats.

## Usage

The main function of the library is to read a DDS image and convert it to a `System.Drawing.Bitmap` object, 
using the `LoadImage` method of the `DDS` class.
It can be used by simply supplying the file path as a string argument.
```
Bitmap bmp = DDS.LoadImage(@".\textures\sample.dds");
```
Overloaded versions of `LoadImage` exist to load from a `byte` array as well as from a `Stream`.

#### Compilation Notes

To speed things up, there is some unsafe code in this program.

If you don't want the *unsafe* routines, compile with the `/define:SAFE_MODE` option, and *safe* routines will be used instead.  

The "safe" routines are very very slow on Microsoft's .NET CLR on Win32,but are still pretty fast on Mono. You have been warned.
